## About Apache Log4j2 Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 & CVE-2021-45046
Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. In previous releases (>2.10) this behavior can be mitigated by setting system property "log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups" to &#8220;true&#8221; or it can be mitigated in prior releases (<2.10) by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class).

It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of service (DOS) attack. Log4j 2.15.0 makes a best-effort attempt to restrict JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Log4j 2.16.0 fixes this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.

          port(9003)
          tls(
              key-file("/mypath/key.pem")
              cert-file("/mypath/cert.pem")
              peer-verify("optional-untrusted")
          )
      );
  };

  destination d_logs {
      tcp("127.0.0.1" port(9004));

Process checks are use to monitor OS processes.
<br>
These checks will be scheduled to run at a fixed interval (default 30 seconds intervals).
<br>
This page shows how to configure emedge-agent process check.

# Configuration Steps
- Ensure the emedge-agent is properly installed, as described <a href="{{< relref "installation/emedge/emedge-agent/installation.md" >}}">here</a>
- Navigate to emedge-agent installation directory (e.g. /opt/emedge-agent)
- Edit config.yml in checks/process to add the process monitor configuration
- Reload the emedge-agent configuration

## Example: to add a process monitor for process with name "proc1", do the following
  - Add one or more sections under 'checks' to **checks/process/config.yml**
    ```yaml
    checks:
      - name: check1
        enabled: false
        process_name: proc1
        interval_secs: 30
      - name: check2
        ...<snipped>...
    ```
  - Run **emedge-agent reload** to trigger emedge-agent to reload the config
  - The process will be monitored and metrics collected will now be forwarding to **emedge**

Custom script checks are well suited to collect metrics from custom applications or special systems.
<br>
These checks will be scheduled to run at a fixed interval (default 30 seconds intervals).
<br>
This page looks at how to configure custom emedge-agent script check.

# Configuration steps
- Ensure the emedge-agent is properly installed, as described <a href="{{< relref "installation/emedge/emedge-agent/installation.md" >}}">here</a>
- Navigate to emedge-agent installation directory (e.g. /opt/emedge-agent)
- Edit config.yml in checks/scripts to add the script configuration
- Reload the emedge-agent

# How to write a custom script
- emedge expects a JSON output from a custom script, in the form of a JSON array of monitor instances (and metrics)
- "name" property of each monitor instance is used as the name of that monitor instance
## Example: to add a custom script sample_check.sh, do the following
  - Sample content of **sample_check.sh**
    ```shell
    #!/bin/sh
    VAL1=111
    VAL2=222
    cat << EOF
    [
      {
        "name" : "monitor1",
        "sample_result1" : ${VAL1},
        "sample_result2" : ${VAL2}
      },
      {
        "name" : "monitor2",
        "sample_result1" : ${VAL1},
        "sample_result2" : ${VAL2}
      }
    ]
    EOF
    ```
  - Add the following content to **config.yml**
    ```yaml
    checks:
      - name: sample_check
        interval_secs: 30
        enabled: false

      - name: 'sample_file_check_1'
        enabled: false
        interval_secs: 30
        filepath: /tmp/my_sample.log
        forward_as_logs: false
        line_checks:
          - name: 'check1'
            contains: 'abc'

It employs protocols such as the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), and Huawei Discovery Protocol (HDP). These protocols grant the function the ability to navigate and map the elaborate interconnections within the network, revealing both all links, including the hidden ones.

The function also features an automatic layout mechanism, which presents the complex network topology in a structured and digestible format. Beyond merely offering a static view, the function allows for user-driven customization of the layouts based on specific needs or preferences. These custom views can be preserved for later use, facilitating a more efficient understanding, management, and troubleshooting of network systems.

In summary, this function delivers a comprehensive and user-adaptable approach to network visualization, combining advanced discovery protocols with customizable views. It provides users with the necessary tools to navigate and comprehend the complexities of their network's architecture, thereby enhancing their ability to manage and troubleshoot their systems effectively.

title: Business Views
geekdocHidden: true

The {{% company %}} console supports Business View, which is an easy-to-use administrative function that integrates all IT components into one comprehensive framework, transforming the IT infrastructure into a business service.

Business View helps overcome problems in developing an effective Service Level Agreement (SLA), allowing service quality, monitoring methods and report generation parameters to be set. Services can include network interfaces, system performance, databases, web services and standard TCP/UDP ports.


![SCREENSHOTS](/modules/home/business_views/images/netgain/Bizviews.PNG)
&nbsp;


Business View sets the framework for using an XML-based, object-oriented model that defines:
* Client services
* Service dependencies
* Service monitoring
* SLA rules and threshold parameters for service monitoring

A typical business framework follows, where an organization can own many services and sub-services, with each relying on one or more monitors. Each monitor has a series of SLA standards and threshold parameters.

AI and machine learning technologies are used for monitoring and anomaly detection within the network management platform. It is applied through machine learning jobs to identify and alert unusual or abnormal conditions in the system metrics.

# Anomaly Detection

It involves identifying data points and patterns that deviate from the norm within a dataset.

# Outlier Detection 

It involves identifying data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data.

# Same steps apply for both Anomaly and Outlier Detection.

You can integrate the alerts generated with your existing OpsGenie, Pager Duty or Service Now ticketing apps. Refer to the appropriate documentation for information on setting up this integration.

OpsGenie – uses API key for integration  (https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/api-integration)

Pager Duty – uses API key, Service ID and User Email ID for integration (https://www.pagerduty.com/sign-up/) 

Service Now – uses URL, Username and Password for integration

**Note**: This plug-in uses Basic Authentication with the ServiceNow REST API, so you would need a valid username and password

	- WebApp 
* Android 
* IOS 
2. MS Teams Account details
3. MS Teams Webhook

## Steps
1. Download MS Teams App for [Windows / MacOS](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/discover) or just simple use the WebApp
2. Register or Login with your Office365 account
3. Add an incoming Webhook to a Teams channel  
	a. Create your team (e.g. “IT Infra Alerts”)  
	b. In your team, create more Channels  
	c. Navigate to the channel where you want to add the Webhook and select (•••) More Options from the top navigation bar.  
	d. Choose Connectors from the drop-down menu and search for Incoming Webhook.  
		![Webhook screenshot](/modules/alerts/images/{{% imagehome %}}/MSTeams.png  "Click Add on the highlighted Incoming Webhook")  
	e. Click add then provide a name, and, optionally, upload an image avatar for your Webhook.  
	f. The dialog window will present a unique URL that will map to the channel. Make sure that you copy and save the URL—you will need to provide it to the outside service.  
	g. Select the Done button. The Webhook will be available in the team channel.  
4. Go now to GUI, Alarms > Notification >  Microsoft Teams and click +Create. Key-in your Label and copy the given Webhook to Microsoft Teams settings  
5. Send Test message, if successful you can now save
6. Create desired notification Rules and don't forget to tick the “Microsoft Teams” box to enable the MS Teams alert messaging.
7. Create your MS Teams content in notification rules or just simply put “default” to receive system generated alarms

title: Alert Correlation
geekdocHidden: true
slug: alertcorrelation

Root Cause rule defines the relation of a root cause object’s alarm to the dependent object’s alarm in a time window.  We can define such rules for well-known dependencies, such as a web-server and a web-site. 

If a root cause alarm arrives prior to the dependent alarms, the dependent alarms are not propagated until the root cause is fixed within a time window.   

This behavior could help to quickly identify the root cause, while helping to focus away from the dependent alarms. For example, if a web-server is down the web-site would be down as well. Therefore, if a root-cause alarm ‘Web-server down’ is present within a reasonable amount of time prior to the arrival of ‘Web-site down’ alarm, then the ‘Web-site down’ alarm will not be sent.

Network Configuration Management (cmdb) is a broad term for the organization and management of a computer network. All types of networks, including local area networks, wireless networks and virtual networks, need some element of maintenance, modification, repair, and general monitoring. cmdb involves collecting different information about hardware devices, software programs and other elements of the network in order to support administration and troubleshooting.

{{% company %}} cmdb is used primarily to backup and restore the configuration of the network and devices.
* Automatic backup of the network device configuration (pull config) and restoration of the configuration back to devices (push config), with auto scheduling capability. 
* Allows for bulk operations (not device by device) 
* Lets you compare configuration changes (eg, current versus history (yesterday, last week, etc.). 
* Supports devices from multiple vendors (eg, Cisco, H3C, Huawei, Juniper, etc.) 

To access cmdb, click on \<CMDB> at the Left Navigation Bar, then click on \<Network Config> at the Top Navigation Bar.
